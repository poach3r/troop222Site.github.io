# Description

Troop 222 visits Antietam National Battlefield Join us as we camp on and tour this historic Civil War battlefield and learn about its history. This trip include a guided tour of the battlefield and camping at a Scouts only campsite on the battlefield grounds. Antietam National Battlefield is the site of the bloodiest one day battle in American history. After twelve hours of savage combat on September 17, 1862, 23,000 soldiers were killed, wounded or missing. The Battle of Antietam ended the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia's first invasion into the North and led to Abraham Lincoln's issuance of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation.
