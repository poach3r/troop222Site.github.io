Our Troop also believes in having as much FUN as possible while achieving our scouting goals. Though we strive for every boy to become an Eagle Scout, the personality of our troop is definitely Easy Going. We have a mostly traditional program where camping, hiking, canoeing and the like are combined with skiing and white water rafting. We meet every Monday night 7:00 PM, at Advent Lutheran Church and have weekend camp-outs and activities once a month. We are a medium size, Scout-Run troop which allows for plenty of Leadership opportunities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Archives</title><link>https://troop222Site.github.io/archives/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://troop222Site.github.io/archives/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Search</title><link>https://troop222Site.github.io/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://troop222Site.github.io/search/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
